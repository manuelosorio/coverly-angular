## Project Description

Smartphone cases are a growing business and **Coverly** is a new company that's jumping on the bandwagon. Their covers have designs that can't be found anywhere else and they want their customers to know it. They regularly send out Calls-to-Artists to create unique, one of a kind designs for their store only. They also have a section for users to upload their own designs. More than just a store for phone cases, they are a showcase for the artists that create for them.

## My Goal 

My overal goal for this project is to recreate coverly from the ground up using Angular for the front-end and Express + MongoDB on the back-end. I'm doing this with the hopes of creating my first fullstack application and gaining an understanding of fullstack javascript development.
